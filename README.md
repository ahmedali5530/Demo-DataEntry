Demo-DataEntry
==============

This is a demo for simple data entry.  It is written in Javascript with Angular JS.

Notes
-----
Since this is a demo, certain shortcuts are made.

- Storing data in Local Storage.
- Storing a whole "table" as one array instead of storing each "row" separately.
- Using the array index as key (this would break if we delete any item).
